NEXUS Repository Cleanup Archive
=================================
Date: 2025-07-02

This file documents the cleanup performed to prepare the NEXUS repository for public release.
All files and directories listed below were removed to eliminate outdated content, 
internal development artifacts, and references to the previous "PRIS" branding.

DELETED FILES (No longer needed)
--------------------------------
1. BLADE-RUNNER-REMOVAL-SUMMARY.md - Old system removal documentation
2. MIGRATION-GUIDE.md - PRIS to NEXUS migration guide
3. ROLLBACK-INSTRUCTIONS.md - Emergency rollback procedures
4. June-19-Enhancements.md - Duplicate enhancement file in root
5. enhancements/June-19-Enhancements.md - Duplicate enhancement file

ARCHIVED DIRECTORIES (Moved to .archive/)
-----------------------------------------
1. .pris/ - Old PRIS runtime directory with legacy branding
   - Contains: patterns/, config/, memories/, history/
   - Reason: Extensive "Blade Runner" references and outdated structure

2. enhancements/ - Internal development history
   - Contains: Enhancement proposals, test results, implementation phases
   - Reason: Internal development artifacts not needed for public use

3. docs/project-status/ - Development progress tracking
   - Contains: EXTRACTION-STATUS.md and other internal tracking
   - Reason: Internal project management documentation

FILES REQUIRING UPDATES
-----------------------
The following files contain PRIS references that need updating:
- README.md
- docs/README.md
- docs/development/*.md
- docs/architecture/*.md
- docs/guides/*.md
- docs/_templates/*.md
- docs/command-mapping.md

Note: The actual command files in commands/ directory have already been 
updated to use NEXUS branding and appear ready for public use.

ARCHIVE LOCATION
----------------
All archived content has been preserved in:
- git-remote-archive-pris.txt (original repository remote)
- .archive/ directory (for historical reference, not tracked in git)
