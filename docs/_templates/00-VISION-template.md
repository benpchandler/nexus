# Product Vision: [Product Name]

*Note: Vision docs define WHY this product should exist and WHERE it's going. PRDs define WHAT features to build.*

## The Opportunity

[1-2 paragraphs: What's broken in the world that we can fix? What's the market opportunity?]

Example:
Every small business owner spends 10+ hours/week on bookkeeping, yet 60% of them still have inaccurate books. Existing solutions are either too complex (QuickBooks) or too simple (spreadsheets). There's a $10B opportunity for software that's powerful enough for real businesses but simple enough that owners actually use it.

## Our Vision

[One paragraph: What world are we creating? Paint the picture 3-5 years out.]

Example:
We envision a world where small business owners never think about bookkeeping. Our AI-powered system automatically categorizes transactions, handles compliance, and provides real-time financial insights. Owners focus on growing their business while we ensure their books are perfect.

## Why Us, Why Now

**Why we can win**: [Unique advantages]
**Why now**: [Market timing]

Example:
**Why us**: Our team built payment processing at Square - we understand small business financial workflows better than anyone.
**Why now**: Open banking APIs finally make automated bookkeeping possible. AI can now categorize transactions with 99% accuracy.

## Target Customer

**Primary**: [Specific user persona]
**Secondary**: [Expansion persona]
**NOT targeting**: [Who we're explicitly not building for]

Example:
**Primary**: Restaurant owners with 1-5 locations, $1-10M revenue
**Secondary**: Retail stores, service businesses
**NOT targeting**: Enterprises, franchises, or businesses needing multi-currency

## Key Risks & Mitigations

| Open banking APIs unreliable | High | Build direct integrations with top 5 banks |
| Restaurants won't trust AI | Medium | Human-in-the-loop for first 6 months |

## Competitive Landscape

Example:
| Competitor | Their Strength | Our Advantage |
|------------|---------------|---------------|
| QuickBooks | Brand, features | 10x easier, restaurant-specific |
| Toast | Restaurant POS | We're POS-agnostic, better books |
| Bench | Human bookkeepers | 1/10th the cost, real-time |

## Core Principles

[3-5 principles that guide all product decisions]

Example:
1. **Invisible Excellence**: Great bookkeeping happens without user effort
2. **Trust Through Transparency**: Show our work, let users verify
3. **Restaurant-First**: Every feature designed for food service reality
4. **Mobile-Native**: Owners work on their phone, not at a desk

## What This Means for PRDs

All feature PRDs should:
- [ ] Align with one of our core principles

- [ ] Move us toward our 3-year metrics
- [ ] Consider competitive differentiation
