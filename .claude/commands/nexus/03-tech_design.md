**Output**: `.claude/.nexus/03-tech_design/{product_name}_03-tech-design.md` with implementation checklist.

## The Technical Design Process

### 1. PRD Analysis & Feature Extraction

<prd_analysis>
**Extract from PRD:** Features by MoSCoW priority, user flows, performance requirements, constraints

**Analytical Framework:** For each Must-Have feature, analyze through multiple lenses:
- **User Experience**: What interfaces and interactions are needed?
- **Data Architecture**: What entities, relationships, and persistence patterns?
- **Performance/Scale**: What are the volume, speed, and reliability needs?
- **Integration**: What external systems or services are required?
- **Security/Compliance**: What protection and regulatory requirements?

**MVP-First Questions:**
- "What's the minimal technical solution for this Phase 0 requirement?"
- "What could we defer to Phase 1 without breaking core value?"
- "What enterprise features belong in Phase 2+?"

*→ Synthesize: Create feature-to-architecture mapping, identify core vs. enhancement patterns*
</prd_analysis>

### 2. Architecture Decision Matrix

<architecture_decisions>
**Decision Framework:** For each core architectural choice, evaluate:

**Pattern Decisions:**
- **Monolith vs Microservices**: Team size, complexity, deployment needs
- **Synchronous vs Asynchronous**: Consistency vs scalability requirements  
- **Event-driven vs Request-response**: Coupling vs simplicity trade-offs

**Technology Stack Analysis:**
- **Phase 0**: Proven, simple technologies that team knows
- **Phase 1**: Add performance/UX improvements with minimal risk
- **Phase 2**: Consider advanced patterns only if business case exists

**Key Questions:**
- "Given our team size and timeline, what's the simplest architecture that works?"
- "What technologies does the team already know vs. need to learn?"
- "Where are the real bottlenecks vs. imagined scale problems?"

*→ Synthesize: Document ADRs with rationale, create technology roadmap by phase*
</architecture_decisions>

### 3. Component & Interface Design

<component_design>
**System Boundaries:** Map PRD features to system components
- **Frontend Components**: UI features, state management needs
- **Backend Services**: Business logic groupings, data ownership
- **External Integrations**: Third-party dependencies, API contracts

**Interface Contracts:**
- **Phase 0**: Simple REST APIs, basic schemas, minimal validation
- **Phase 1**: Add versioning, enhanced validation, better error handling
- **Phase 2**: GraphQL, event schemas, advanced patterns

**Progressive Complexity:**
- "What's the simplest API design that supports the core user flow?"
- "Which interface complexities can we defer until we have real usage data?"
- "What integration points are truly necessary vs. nice-to-have?"

*→ Synthesize: Create API specification, define service boundaries, plan integration strategy*
</component_design>

### 4. Data Architecture & Flow Design

<data_architecture>
**Data Modeling by Phase:**
- **Phase 0**: Essential entities, simple relationships, basic indexes
- **Phase 1**: Add audit trails, user preferences, performance indexes
- **Phase 2**: Analytics tables, complex relationships, optimization

**Flow Patterns:**
- **Happy Path**: Core user journey, minimal complexity
- **Error Scenarios**: Essential error handling, basic recovery
- **Edge Cases**: Defer complex edge cases to later phases

**Consistency Strategy:**
- "Where do we need strong consistency vs. eventual consistency?"
- "What data can we afford to lose vs. must never lose?"
- "Which queries will be frequent vs. rare?"

*→ Synthesize: Design database schema, map data flows, identify consistency boundaries*
</data_architecture>

### 5. Resilience Strategy

<resilience_strategy>
**Error Handling by Priority:**
- **Phase 0**: Basic try/catch, simple retries, user-friendly error messages
- **Phase 1**: Circuit breakers for external services, structured logging
- **Phase 2**: Advanced patterns, distributed tracing, chaos engineering

**Monitoring Approach:**
- "What failures would actually impact users vs. just metrics?"
- "Which systems are critical path vs. enhancement features?"
- "What can we monitor with simple tools vs. requiring complex infrastructure?"

**Graceful Degradation:**
- Essential features that must always work
- Enhanced features that can fail gracefully
- Advanced features that can be disabled

*→ Synthesize: Define error handling patterns, create monitoring plan, establish SLA requirements*
</resilience_strategy>

### 6. Testing & Deployment Strategy

<testing_deployment>
**Test Strategy by Phase:**
- **Phase 0**: Unit tests for business logic, basic integration tests
- **Phase 1**: E2E tests for critical paths, performance baselines
- **Phase 2**: Advanced testing, load testing, security testing

**Deployment Approach:**
- "What's the simplest deployment that reduces risk?"
- "Which CI/CD features are essential vs. optimization?"
- "What manual processes are acceptable initially vs. must automate?"

**Environment Strategy:**
- Development: Local development setup
- Staging: Production-like validation environment
- Production: Gradual rollout capabilities

*→ Synthesize: Create test plan, define deployment pipeline, establish quality gates*

</implementation_readiness>

## Example Session

<example>
**Bakery Order Management - Technical Analysis**

**PRD Analysis:**
"Looking at the PRD's Must-Have features: order scheduling with conflict detection (RICE: 240) and custom detail capture (RICE: 128). Let me analyze through different lenses..."

**Multi-Lens Analysis:**
- **UX Lens**: Need order form, availability checker, confirmation flow
- **Data Lens**: Orders table, customer data, inventory tracking
- **Performance Lens**: PRD mentions 5-minute confirmation - not real-time critical
- **Integration Lens**: Email notifications, calendar integration mentioned in Phase 1
- **Security Lens**: Customer data protection, payment handling in Phase 2

**Architecture Decisions:**
- **Monolith vs Microservices**: "Small team (3 devs), 6-month timeline → Monolith with modular structure"
- **Database**: "PostgreSQL sufficient for order volume, familiar to team"
- **Caching**: "Defer Redis until Phase 1 - availability checks aren't high-frequency"

**Phase Mapping:**
- **Phase 0**: React frontend, Node.js API, PostgreSQL, manual confirmation emails
- **Phase 1**: Add Redis caching, automated notifications, better validation
- **Phase 2**: Payment integration, mobile optimization, advanced analytics

**Key Decision Rationale**: "Chose simple stack over trendy one - team velocity more important than perfect architecture"
</example>

## Analysis Toolkit

<analysis_techniques>
**Analytical Lenses:**
- **User Experience**: "What interfaces, interactions, and user flows does this require?"
- **Data Architecture**: "What entities, relationships, and queries does this imply?"
- **Performance/Scale**: "What are the volume, latency, and reliability implications?"
- **Integration**: "What external systems, APIs, or services are needed?"
- **Security/Compliance**: "What data protection, access control, or regulatory needs?"

**MVP-First Analysis:**
- **Phase 0 Filter**: "What's the simplest implementation that delivers core value?"
- **Complexity Check**: "What can we defer without breaking the user experience?"
- **Risk Assessment**: "What technologies/patterns match our team's capabilities?"

**Decision Framework:**
- **Trade-off Analysis**: "What are we optimizing for: speed, scale, or simplicity?"
- **Constraint Check**: "Given timeline, team, and requirements, what's realistic?"
- **Future Flexibility**: "What decisions are reversible vs. one-way doors?"

**When to Ask Users:**
- Performance requirements unclear in PRD
- Integration details missing or ambiguous
- Regulatory/compliance requirements not specified
- Business rules need clarification

*Remember: Analyze systematically through all lenses, then synthesize into coherent technical approach.*

  status VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders(customer_id);
```

### Relationships
- Orders → Customer (many-to-one)
- Orders → Order Items (one-to-many)

## Sequence Diagrams
### Create Order Flow
1. User submits → Frontend validates → API receives
2. API validates → Checks inventory → Creates record
3. Publishes event → Notification service → Confirmation
4. Returns response → Frontend shows success

## Error Handling & Resilience
### Patterns

- **Timeout**: Long-running operations

### Monitoring
