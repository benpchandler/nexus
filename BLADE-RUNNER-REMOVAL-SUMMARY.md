# Blade Runner Reference Removal Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all Blade Runner references that were removed from the NEXUS codebase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Direct Quotes Removed
- `/commands/07-refine.md`: "All those bugs will be fixed in time, like tears in rain." → "All those bugs will be fixed in time." - Quality Assurance
- `/commands/98-patterns.md`: "More Human Than Human" - Tyrell Corp → "Building Better Code Through Proven Patterns"
- `/.pris/patterns/README.md`: "More human than human" → "Building on proven patterns for reliability and consistency"
- `/June-19-Enhancements.md`: "More human than human" - Tyrell Corporation → "Building better software through intelligent automation"

### 2. Terminology Changes
- `inception.log` → `operations.log` (system operation log)
- `retirement.log` → `errors.log` (error tracking)
- `cells/` → `history/` (historical snapshots directory)
- `90-retirement/` → `90-deprecated/` (deprecated artifacts)
- "baseline anomalies" → "known issues"

### 3. Updated Files
Command files updated:
- `00-initialize.md`
- `01-discover.md`
- `02-prioritize.md`
- `03-architect.md`
- `04-scaffold.md`
- `05-construct.md`
- `06-verify.md`
- `07-refine.md`
- `09-decompose_epic.md`
- `12-review_code.md`
- `90-validate.md`
- `92-migrate.md`
- `93-spawn_parallel.md`
- `98-patterns.md`
- `utils/test-correction-loop.md`

Documentation files updated:
- `/README.md`
- `/CLAUDE.md`
- `/commands/README.md`
- `/docs/README.md`
- `/docs/development/README.md`
- `/docs/project-structure-example.md`
- `/docs/development/PRIS-DOCUMENTATION-WORKFLOW.md` → `/docs/development/NEXUS-DOCUMENTATION-WORKFLOW.md`
- `/.pris/config.yaml`

### 4. Preserved References
The following files contain historical references and were intentionally preserved:
- `/ROLLBACK-INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Documents the old state for rollback purposes
- `/docs/command-mapping.md` - Historical mapping of old command names
- `/docs/project-status/EXTRACTION-STATUS.md` - Historical project status
- `/enhancements/` - Test results documenting the old behavior

### 5. Command Name References
Updated references from old character-based names to new functional names throughout documentation:
- `00-baseline.md` → `00-initialize.md`
- `01-voight-kampff.md` → `01-discover.md`
- `04-sebastian.md` → `04-scaffold.md`
- `05-wallace.md` → `12-review_code.md`
- `09-stelline.md` → `11-create_handoff.md`
- `13-tearsInRain.md` → `92-migrate.md`

## Result
All Blade Runner references have been successfully removed from active code and documentation. The system now uses professional, descriptive terminology while maintaining its cyberpunk aesthetic through the Voight-Kampff Eye Test ASCII art (which is acceptable as a visual element).

The NEXUS system is now completely free of forced Blade Runner references while maintaining its technical identity and functionality.
