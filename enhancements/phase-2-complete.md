# Phase 2 Complete: Automated Testing & Correction Loops

## Summary

Successfully implemented the Automated Testing & Correction Loop enhancement for PRIS, adding self-healing capability through intelligent test-driven iteration.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Test Verification Command (05-verify.md)
Created comprehensive test execution and analysis:
- Multi-framework support (Jest, Vitest, Pytest, Go test, etc.)
- Intelligent test output parsing
- Failure analysis with correction hints
- Quality gate integration (linting, type checking, coverage)

### 2. Build Orchestrator Command (06-build.md)
Implemented the meta-command that coordinates the full cycle:
- Calls 07-construct for implementation + tests
- Runs 05-verify to execute tests
- Analyzes failures and generates corrections
- Applies fixes and retries (up to 3 attempts)
- Tracks all attempts in build state

### 3. Enhanced Test Generation
Updated 07-construct.md to automatically generate tests:
- Analyzes implementation to identify testable components
- Generates comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, e2e)
- Covers happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Uses coverage-driven generation strategy

### 4. Test-Correction Loop Utility
Created reusable correction logic in `commands/utils/test-correction-loop.md`:
- Failure pattern recognition
- Correction strategy selection
- Targeted fix generation
- Build state management

### 5. Configuration & State Tracking
- Enabled testing in `.pris/config.yaml` (marked as BETA)
- Implemented `.build_state.json` for attempt tracking
- Added retry logic with configurable limits
- Quality gates with thresholds

## How It Works

1. **Build Initiation**: `pris 06-build TICKET-123`
2. **Implementation**: Generates code AND comprehensive tests
3. **Test Execution**: Runs all tests, parses results
4. **Failure Analysis**: Identifies why tests fail
5. **Correction**: Generates targeted fixes
6. **Retry**: Re-runs tests, up to 3 attempts
7. **Quality Gates**: Checks linting, types, coverage
8. **Success/Failure**: Reports final status with details

## Testing the Enhancement

```bash
# Enable testing in config
# testing.enabled: true in .pris/config.yaml

# Run build command
pris 06-build <ticket-id>

# Watch as PRIS:
# - Generates implementation
# - Creates tests
# - Runs tests
# - Fixes failures automatically
# - Validates quality
```

## Key Features

### Intelligent Failure Analysis
- Pattern matching for common errors
- Specific correction strategies
- Context-aware fixes

### Comprehensive Test Generation
- Unit tests for functions
- Integration tests for APIs
- Component tests for UI
- Edge case coverage

### Quality Assurance
- Linting with auto-fix
- Type checking
- Coverage thresholds
- Security scanning (optional)

### Detailed Tracking
```json
{
  "attempts": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "success": false,
      "failures": 5,
      "corrections_applied": [
        "Fixed null check in userService",
        "Added missing import"
      ]
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "success": true,
      "failures": 0,
      "quality_results": {
        "coverage": 87.5
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 80% of generated code passes tests first try (goal)
- ✅ Automatic fixing of common errors
- ✅ Reduced manual debugging time
- ✅ Higher code quality through enforced testing

## Example Output

```
🚀 Starting build for FEAT-101...
📝 Generating implementation and tests...
✅ Code generated successfully

🧪 Running tests (Attempt 1/3)...
❌ 5 tests failing

🔧 Applying corrections...
✅ Fixed: Missing null checks (2)
✅ Fixed: Type mismatches (3)

🧪 Running tests (Attempt 2/3)...
✅ All tests passing!

📊 Running quality gates...
✅ Linting: Passed
✅ Types: No errors
✅ Coverage: 87%

✨ Build completed successfully!
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: Sub-Agent Orchestration
- Discovery spike for Task tool capabilities
- Implement 14-spawn.md orchestrator
- Enable parallel agent execution
- Add proper isolation and coordination

## Configuration

Current settings in `.pris/config.yaml`:
```yaml
testing:
  enabled: true                    # Now active!
  max_correction_attempts: 3       
  test_timeout_seconds: 300        
  auto_fix: true                   
  quality_gates:
    linting: true                  
    type_checking: true            
    security_scan: false           
    coverage_threshold: 80         
```

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise:
1. Set `testing.enabled: false` in `.pris/config.yaml`
2. Use `07-construct` directly without `06-build`
3. Tests and corrections remain available for manual use
