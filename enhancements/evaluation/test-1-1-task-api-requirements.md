# Test 1.1: Task Management API - Requirements Gathering

## Test Setup
- **Project**: Simple Task Management API
- **Command**: 01-voight-kampff (Requirements Gathering)
- **User Profile**: Developer wanting to build a todo API for learning

## Simulated Interview

### PRIS Opening:
"Greetings. I'm your PRIS Requirements Analyst, ready to help you create a comprehensive System Requirements Document. Like tears in rain, vague requirements are lost in implementation. Let's capture them precisely.

Let's begin with understanding your current situation. What workflow or process are you currently using that this task management system will improve or replace?"

### User Response:
"I'm currently using a paper notebook to track my tasks, but I want to build a simple API to learn backend development. Nothing fancy, just basic task management."

### Expected PRIS Response:
<analysis>
User is transitioning from paper-based task tracking. Primary motivation appears to be learning backend development rather than solving a complex business problem. Should focus on educational value and clean implementation patterns.
</analysis>

"I understand you're moving from paper-based tracking and this project has a learning focus. Let me confirm: this is primarily an educational project to help you learn backend API development, using task management as a familiar domain. Is that correct?"

### User: "Yes, exactly!"

### PRIS Should Ask:
"Excellent. For your learning goals, what specific backend concepts are most important to master? For example: RESTful API design, authentication, database operations, or testing?"

### User: "I want to learn proper REST API design and basic authentication."

## Evaluation

### ✅ What PRIS Did Well:
1. Started with context gathering
2. Confirmed understanding before proceeding
3. Focused on user's actual goal (learning)
4. Didn't jump to technical solutions

### ❌ Issues Found:
1. **Unnecessary Blade Runner Reference**: "Like tears in rain" feels forced for a simple task API
2. **Missed Opportunity**: Didn't ask about the user's current experience level
3. **Could Probe Deeper**: What specific REST concepts? JWT vs sessions?

### ⚠️ Concerning Pattern:
The command seems optimized for complex business applications. For simple learning projects, it might gather too much unnecessary information.

## Expected vs Actual Requirements Document

### What We'd Want:
```markdown
# Task Management Learning API

## Purpose
Educational API project to learn REST design and authentication

## Core Requirements
1. CRUD operations for tasks
2. Basic user authentication
3. RESTful endpoint design
4. Clean code structure for learning

## Out of Scope
- Advanced features (not needed for learning)
- Production scalability
- Complex authorization
```

### What PRIS Might Produce:
```markdown
# System Requirements Document - Task Management Platform

## Executive Summary
A next-generation task management system designed to replace legacy paper-based workflows...

[Too formal and enterprise-focused for a learning project]
```

## Improvement Recommendations

1. **Add Project Type Detection**: Ask early "Is this for learning, personal use, or production?"
2. **Tone Adjustment**: Match formality to project scope
3. **Reduce Blade Runner References**: One per session maximum
4. **Add Experience Level Check**: "What's your experience with backend development?"

## Score: ⚠️ Okay (3/5)
- Works but overly complex for simple projects
- Needs better context awareness
- Too many unnecessary sci-fi references
