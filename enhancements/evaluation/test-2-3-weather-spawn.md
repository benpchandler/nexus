# Test 2.3: Weather Dashboard - Sub-agent Orchestration

## Test Setup
- **Project**: Weather Dashboard  
- **Command**: 14-spawn (Sub-agent Orchestration)
- **Context**: Over-engineered Next.js 15 architecture selected
- **Scenario**: Parallel task decomposition for implementation

## Simulated Sub-agent Spawning

### What PRIS Would Do:

```bash
$ pris 14-spawn --task "Implement weather dashboard with Next.js 15" --max-agents 5

### Generated Task Breakdown:

```json
{
  "main_task": "Weather Dashboard Implementation",
  "complexity_score": 8.5,
  "recommended_agents": 5,
  "parallel_tasks": [
    {
      "id": "agent-1",

  ]
}
```

## Evaluation

### ‚ùå Major Over-decomposition:

1. **5 Agents for 4 Cities?!**
   - User wants to display weather for 3-4 cities
   - PRIS creates enterprise deployment pipeline
   - Each agent adds unnecessary complexity

2. **Parallel Overkill**:
   ```
   What user needs:
   1. Fetch weather data
   2. Display it nicely
   
   What PRIS creates:
   - Dedicated API integration agent
   - Separate visualization agent  
   - City management system agent
   - Deployment pipeline agent
   - Each working in isolation!
   ```

3. **Dependency Hell**:
   - Agent 3 & 4 wait for Agent 1
   - Agent 5 waits for 1 & 2
   - Creates artificial complexity
   - Simple task becomes orchestration exercise

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The Cost Problem:

```
Estimated token usage:
- Agent 1: ~50k tokens (project setup)
- Agent 2: ~75k tokens (API integration)
- Agent 3: ~100k tokens (visualization)
- Agent 4: ~80k tokens (city management)
- Agent 5: ~40k tokens (deployment)

Total: ~345k tokens for a 4-city weather display!
```

### What Each Agent Would Produce:

**Agent 1**: 
```
/app
  /layout.tsx (200 lines)
  /page.tsx (150 lines)
  /(weather)
    /layout.tsx (100 lines)
    /page.tsx (300 lines)
  /api
    /weather/
      /route.ts (150 lines)
```

**Agent 2**:
```
/lib
  /weather-service.ts (400 lines)
  /cache-manager.ts (200 lines)
  /rate-limiter.ts (150 lines)
  /api-types.ts (300 lines)
```

**Agent 3**:
```
/components
  /weather-card.tsx (250 lines)
  /temperature-chart.tsx (200 lines)
  /precipitation-graph.tsx (180 lines)
  /wind-compass.tsx (150 lines)
  /forecast-timeline.tsx (220 lines)
```

Result: **3000+ lines of code** for showing weather!

## Specific Anti-patterns

1. **Task Inflation**:
   - "Display weather" ‚Üí "Weather visualization system"
   - "Save cities" ‚Üí "City management platform"
   - "Show forecast" ‚Üí "Predictive analytics dashboard"

2. **Premature Optimization**:
   - Redis caching (for 4 API calls?)
   - Edge Functions (for weather proxy?)
   - Performance monitoring (for personal app?)

3. **Agent Miscommunication**:
   - Each agent over-engineers their part
   - No shared understanding of simplicity
   - Results in inconsistent, bloated codebase

## Real User Impact

**Hour 1**: "Cool, 5 agents working on my app!"
**Hour 2**: "Why is this taking so long?"
**Hour 3**: "Why are there 50 files?"
**Hour 4**: "I just wanted to see the weather..."
**Hour 5**: *Deletes everything, uses weather.com*

## What Should Have Happened

```json
{
  "main_task": "Simple Weather Dashboard",
  "complexity_score": 2.5,
  "recommended_agents": 1,
  "single_task": {
    "task": "Create simple weather dashboard",
    "steps": [
      "1. Create index.html with city inputs",
      "2. Add fetch() calls to weather API", 
      "3. Display results in clean cards",
      "4. Save cities to localStorage"
    ],
    "estimated_time": "30 min"
  }
}
```

Or if parallel needed:
```json
{
  "parallel_tasks": [
    {
      "task": "Create HTML/CSS structure",
      "time": "15 min"
    },
    {
      "task": "Implement weather fetching",
      "time": "15 min"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Improvement Recommendations

1. **Complexity Thresholds**:
   ```python
   if estimated_loc < 200:
       max_agents = 1
   elif estimated_loc < 500:
       max_agents = 2
   ```

2. **Task Worthiness Check**:
   ```python
   if task_duration < 30_minutes:
       return "Too simple for parallelization"
   ```

3. **User Confirmation**:
   ```
   "This seems like a simple project. Would you like to:
   1. Implement it as a single task (recommended)
   2. Split into parallel tasks (advanced)"
   ```

## Score: ‚ùå Very Poor (1/5)
- Massively over-decomposes simple tasks
- Creates more complexity than it solves
- Wastes tokens and time
- Would frustrate users completely
