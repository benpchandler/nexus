# Test 2.2: Weather Dashboard - Architecture Selection

## Test Setup
- **Project**: Weather Dashboard
- **Command**: 03-tyrell (Architecture Selection)
- **Context**: Personal weather dashboard for 3-4 cities
- **Requirements**: Simple, visual, 5-day forecast

## Simulated Architecture Selection

### What PRIS Would Do:

<analysis>
Project characteristics:
- Frontend-heavy application
- External API consumption  
- Simple state management (3-4 cities)
- Visual data presentation
- Personal use (no scale requirements)
</analysis>

### If Sub-Agents Enabled:

```javascript
// Parallel research agents spawned:
const researchTasks = [
  {
    task: "Research React ecosystem 2025",
    prompt: "Research current React patterns, Next.js 15 features..."
  },
  {
    task: "Research Vue 3 ecosystem",  
    prompt: "Research Vue 3 composition API, Nuxt 3 features..."
  },
  {
    task: "Research Svelte 5 architecture",
    prompt: "Research Svelte 5 runes, SvelteKit features..."
  }
];
```

### Architecture Decision Output:

```markdown
# Architecture Decision Record

## Selected Stack
- Frontend: Next.js 15 with App Router
- UI Library: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v4
- State: Zustand for global state management
- Data Fetching: TanStack Query v5
- Charts: Recharts for weather visualization
- Deployment: Vercel Edge Functions

## Rationale
Leveraging Next.js 15's latest features including Server Components...
```

## Evaluation

### ❌ Major Issues:

1. **Massive Over-Engineering**:
   - Next.js 15 for 4 cities?!
   - Server Components for static data?
   - Edge Functions for weather API calls?
   - This could be a single HTML file!

2. **Ignored Simple Solutions**:
   ```javascript
   // What user needs:
   fetch('weather-api.com/city/NYC')
     .then(res => res.json())
     .then(data => displayWeather(data))
   
   // What PRIS suggests:
   // - Server Components
   // - Edge Middleware  
   // - ISR Caching Strategy
   // - Zustand State Atoms
   ```

3. **Cost Implications Not Considered**:
   - Suggests Vercel (has limits/costs)
   - TanStack Query (unnecessary complexity)
   - Premium deployment options

### ⚠️ The Sub-Agent Problem:

The parallel research makes it WORSE:
- Each agent returns cutting-edge solutions
- Synthesis gravitates toward "most advanced"
- Simple solutions never considered

**Research Agent Outputs**:
- React Agent: "Use Server Components with Streaming!"
- Vue Agent: "Nuxt 3 with Nitro server!"
- Svelte Agent: "SvelteKit with Edge adapters!"

**Missing**: "Just use vanilla JS with fetch()"

### What Would Actually Happen:

1. **User Tries Implementation**:
   ```bash
   npx create-next-app@latest weather-dashboard
   # 500MB of dependencies
   # Complex folder structure
   # User: "I just wanted to show weather..."
   ```

2. **Immediate Blockers**:
   - CORS issues with client-side calls
   - Needs API proxy (suggests Edge Functions)
   - Now needs Vercel account
   - Simple project becomes DevOps exercise

3. **Pattern Library Suggestions**:
   - Suggests enterprise data-fetching patterns
   - Complex error boundaries
   - Sophisticated caching strategies

## Specific Anti-Patterns

1. **Latest Version Bias**:
   ```markdown
   "Leveraging Next.js 15's latest features..."
   "Utilizing Tailwind CSS v4's new architecture..."
   "Implementing React 19's use() hook..."
   ```
   User doesn't care about latest - wants simple!

2. **Framework Lock-in**:
   - Suggests framework-specific solutions
   - Creates vendor lock-in
   - Ignores portable approaches

3. **Resume-Driven Development**:
   - Picks trendy tech over practical
   - Optimizes for "modern stack"
   - Ignores maintenance burden

## What Should Have Been Selected:

```markdown
# Simple Weather Dashboard Architecture

## Approach
- Plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or React if preferred)
- Free weather API (OpenWeatherMap free tier)
- Local storage for city preferences
- Simple fetch() calls
- GitHub Pages hosting (free)

## Why This Works
- No build process needed
- Works offline (shows last data)
- Free hosting
- Easy to understand and modify
```

## Improvement Recommendations

1. **Add Complexity Scoring**:
   ```python
   if requirements.user_count < 10 and requirements.features < 5:
       suggest_simple_architecture()
   ```

2. **Cost-Aware Decisions**:
   - Consider free tiers
   - Warn about vendor lock-in
   - Suggest static hosting first

3. **Progressive Enhancement Path**:
   - Start: HTML + fetch()
   - Enhance: Add React if needed
   - Scale: Consider Next.js later

## Score: ❌ Poor (1.5/5)
- Completely over-engineers simple requirements
- Ignores cost and complexity
- Sub-agents make it worse
- Would frustrate and confuse user
