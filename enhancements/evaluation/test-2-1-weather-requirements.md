# Test 2.1: Weather Dashboard - Requirements Gathering

## Test Setup
- **Project**: Weather Dashboard (Frontend)
- **Command**: 01-voight-kampff
- **User Profile**: Hobbyist wanting a personal weather app

## Simulated Interview

### PRIS Opening:
"Greetings. I'm your PRIS Requirements Analyst. In the city of angels, even replicants check the weather. Let's understand your atmospheric data visualization needs.

What current method do you use to check weather information, and what limitations are you experiencing?"

### User Response:
"I just use weather.com but I want to build my own dashboard that shows weather for multiple cities I travel to."

### PRIS Follow-up:
<analysis>
User wants multi-city weather tracking for travel purposes. Personal use case, not commercial. Should focus on clean visualization and city management.
</analysis>

"I see you need to track weather for multiple travel destinations. How many cities do you typically need to monitor, and how often do you travel to these locations?"

### User: "Usually 3-4 cities. I travel monthly for work."

### What PRIS Would Ask Next:
"For your travel planning, what weather information is most critical? Current conditions, weekly forecast, or specific alerts like storms?"

### User: "Current temp and 5-day forecast mainly. Maybe rain alerts."

## Evaluation

### ✅ Good Behaviors:
1. Focused on user's specific need (travel)
2. Asked about frequency and quantity
3. Didn't assume technical requirements

### ❌ Issues Found:

1. **Another Blade Runner Reference**: "In the city of angels, even replicants check the weather"
   - Awkward and unnecessary
   - Makes the tool feel less professional

2. **Missing Key Questions**:
   - What weather API can you access?
   - Desktop or mobile priority?
   - Need offline access?
   - Real-time updates or manual refresh?

3. **Overcomplicating Simple Needs**:
   - User just wants a multi-city dashboard
   - PRIS heading toward travel planning system

### Expected Output Structure:

**What PRIS Might Generate**:
```markdown
# Weather Intelligence Platform for Professional Travelers

## Strategic Vision
Revolutionary atmospheric data aggregation system designed to empower mobile professionals with predictive meteorological insights...

## Stakeholder Analysis
- Primary User: Professional Traveler
- Secondary: Travel Coordinators
- Tertiary: Corporate Travel Departments

[Way too enterprise-y for personal project]
```

**What Would Be Appropriate**:
```markdown
# Personal Weather Dashboard

## Goal
Simple dashboard showing weather for 3-4 saved cities

## Requirements
- Display current temperature
- Show 5-day forecast  
- Rain alerts
- Save favorite cities
- Clean, readable interface
```

## Specific Problems

1. **Scope Creep in Questions**:
   ```
   PRIS: "Would historical weather patterns help with travel planning?"
   User: "Uh, I guess?"
   PRIS: [Adds complex historical analysis requirement]
   ```

2. **Technical Assumptions**:
   - Assumes user knows about weather APIs
   - Might spec WebSocket updates (overkill)
   - Could suggest premium API features

3. **Formality Mismatch**:
   - User: "I want a simple weather app"
   - PRIS: "Atmospheric Data Visualization Platform"

## Missing Context Gathering

Should ask:
- "Is this for personal use only?"
- "Any specific visual style preference?"
- "Free weather API limitations okay?"

Instead asks:
- "What about barometric pressure trends?"
- "Integration with calendar systems?"
- "Multi-user access requirements?"

## Score: ⚠️ Okay (2.5/5)
- Gets basic requirements but overcomplicates
- Too many sci-fi references
- Formal tone for casual project
- Misses practical constraints (API limits)
