# Orchestration Features (Archived)

This directory contains complex multi-agent coordination features that were temporarily moved out of the core NEXUS workflow to focus on simplicity.

## What's Here

The orchestration system includes:
- Agent status tracking and mailbox communication
- Work contracts (active/completed)  
- Shared contexts and boundaries
- Complex coordination infrastructure

## Why Archived

These features were designed for enterprise-scale parallel AI development but violated the "start simple, grow consciously" principle. They add significant complexity that most projects don't need.

## Future Consideration

These features may be reintroduced later if:
1. Core workflow is proven and stable
2. Actual need for complex coordination emerges
3. Simpler coordination approaches are insufficient

For now, focus on the core development workflow in the main commands.
