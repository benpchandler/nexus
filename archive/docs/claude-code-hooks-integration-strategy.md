# Claude Code Hooks Integration Strategy for NEXUS

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for integrating Claude Code Hooks into the NEXUS AI-assisted development workflow system. The integration will enhance automation, enforce quality gates, and improve the systematic nature of NEXUS while maintaining its flexibility and human oversight.

## Background

### NEXUS Overview
NEXUS is a sophisticated AI-assisted development workflow system featuring:
- Structured commands (01-discover through 12-review_code)
- Living documentation system (.nexus/ folders)
- Systematic development workflows with version research
- Simplicity mode detection for appropriate complexity management

### Claude Code Hooks Overview
Claude Code Hooks are user-defined shell commands that execute at various points in Claude Code's lifecycle:
- **PreToolUse**: Execute before tool calls, can block/approve operations
- **PostToolUse**: Execute after tool completion
- **Notification**: Custom notification handling
- **Stop/SubagentStop**: Control when Claude stops processing
- **MCP Integration**: Work seamlessly with Model Context Protocol tools

## Integration Opportunities Analysis

### 1. Documentation Automation (High Impact, Low Risk)
**Hook Type**: PostToolUse
**Triggers**: File creation/modification in .nexus/ directories
**Benefits**:
- Auto-update documentation indices
- Maintain consistency across living documentation
- Generate timestamps and metadata automatically
- Sync related documents when changes occur

### 2. Workflow Validation (High Impact, Medium Risk)
**Hook Type**: PreToolUse
**Triggers**: NEXUS command execution
**Benefits**:
- Enforce proper command sequence (e.g., 03-architect before 04-scaffold)
- Validate required files exist before proceeding
- Check for simplicity mode compliance
- Ensure proper naming conventions (M##_, T##_, etc.)

### 3. Quality Gates (Medium Impact, Low Risk)
**Hook Type**: PreToolUse/PostToolUse
**Triggers**: Code changes, dependency updates
**Benefits**:
- Version compatibility checking during architecture phase
- Code style enforcement based on project context
- Test requirement validation
- Security scanning integration

### 4. State Management (High Impact, Low Risk)
**Hook Type**: Stop/SubagentStop
**Triggers**: Command completion, phase transitions
**Benefits**:
- Track completed NEXUS commands
- Auto-save session state to .nexus/history/
- Maintain project phase state
- Backup critical decisions automatically

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Priority**: High Impact, Low Risk implementations

#### 1.1 Documentation Automation
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.nexus/hooks/update-documentation-index.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 1.2 File Naming Validation
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.nexus/hooks/validate-nexus-naming.py"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Phase Tracking
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.nexus/hooks/track-phase-completion.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Workflow Enhancement (Weeks 3-4)
**Priority**: Medium Impact, Medium Risk implementations

#### 2.1 Command Sequence Validation
- Validate prerequisites before NEXUS command execution
- Check for required .nexus/ files and structure
- Enforce workflow dependencies

#### 2.2 Architecture Decision Automation
- Auto-generate ADRs when technology choices are made
- Trigger version research when dependencies change
- Validate architecture decisions against project constraints

#### 2.3 Simplicity Mode Enforcement
- Validate technology choices against simplicity constraints
- Block complex patterns when simplicity mode is detected
- Provide alternative suggestions for simpler approaches

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration (Weeks 5-8)
**Priority**: High Value, Higher Complexity

#### 3.1 Quality Gate Integration
- Integration with linting, testing, security tools
- Automated code review based on NEXUS patterns
- Performance and security validation

#### 3.2 MCP Tool Integration
- Custom MCP tools for NEXUS-specific operations
- Integration with project management tools
- Version control automation

#### 3.3 Cross-Project Learning
- Share patterns and decisions across NEXUS projects
- Build knowledge base of successful implementations
- Automated pattern recognition and suggestions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hook Script Structure
All NEXUS hooks will follow a consistent structure:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# NEXUS Hook: [Hook Name]
# Purpose: [Description]
# Trigger: [When it runs]

# Load NEXUS utilities
source ~/.nexus/hooks/lib/nexus-utils.sh

# Parse JSON input
input=$(cat)
tool_name=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_name // empty')
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')

# NEXUS-specific logic
if is_nexus_project; then
    # Implement hook logic
    validate_and_execute
fi
```

### Configuration Management
- Hooks stored in `~/.nexus/hooks/` directory
- Configuration templates for different project types
- Easy installation and update mechanism
- Version control integration for team sharing

### Error Handling and Logging
- Comprehensive logging to `.nexus/logs/hooks.log`
- Graceful degradation when hooks fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
