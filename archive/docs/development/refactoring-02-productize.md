# Refactoring: 02-prioritize → 02-productize

## Summary
Refactored the 02 command from "prioritize" to "productize" to better reflect its true purpose.

## Changes Made

### 1. Command Rename
- `02-prioritize.md` → `02-productize.md`
- Better reflects that it creates a product strategy, not just a prioritized list

### 2. Output File Update  
- From: `.nexus/memories/_20-BACKLOG.md`
- To: `.nexus/PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md`
- Moved to root .nexus directory (not in memories)
- More accurate name for the comprehensive product strategy document

### 3. Content Updates
- Title: "Product Backlog Prioritization" → "Productize"
- Role: Now focuses on "strategic product plans" not just "prioritized backlogs"
- Output: "Product Strategy" instead of "Prioritized Product Backlog"

### 4. Size Reduction
- Original: 634 lines
- Refactored: 55 lines (91.3% reduction)
- Maintains all core functionality while leveraging Claude 4's capabilities

### 5. Updated References
- README.md: Updated command description
- commands/README.md: Updated workflow diagram
- All dependent commands: Updated file path references

## Philosophy
The refactoring follows modern prompt engineering principles:
- Concise over verbose
- Principles over prescriptions  
- Adaptive over static
- Trust AI capabilities

## Impact
- More accurate naming reflects true purpose
- Cleaner file organization (strategy doc at root level)
- Dramatically simplified command improves maintainability
- Better leverages Claude 4's reasoning capabilities
