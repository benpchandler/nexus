## Claude Code Hooks Integration Strategy

### Hook Types and Applications

#### PreToolUse Hooks (Validation & Prerequisites)
**Purpose**: Validate prerequisites and enforce workflow discipline
**Applications**:
- Command sequence validation (e.g., 03-architect before 04-scaffold)
- File existence verification (e.g., requirements before architecture)
- Simplicity mode compliance checking
- Architecture pattern validation

**Example Implementation**:
```python
def validate_command_sequence(tool_input):
    """Ensure NEXUS commands are executed in proper sequence"""
    current_command = extract_nexus_command(tool_input)
    if current_command == "04-scaffold":
        if not os.path.exists(".nexus/memories/_30-ARCHITECTURE.md"):
            return {"decision": "block", "reason": "Architecture decision required before scaffolding"}
    return {"decision": "approve"}
```

#### PostToolUse Hooks (Automation & Documentation)
**Purpose**: Automate documentation and maintain system state
**Applications**:
- Automatic `.nexus/` file creation and updates

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# update-documentation-index.sh
file_path=$(echo "$input" | jq -r '.tool_input.file_path')
if [[ "$file_path" == *".nexus/"* ]]; then
    echo "- $(basename "$file_path") | $file_path | Updated | $(date)" >> .nexus/memories/_DOCUMENTATION.md
fi
```
