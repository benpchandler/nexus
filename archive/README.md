# NEXUS - Custom Claude Code Slash Commands

*Advanced AI-powered development workflow system for Claude Code*

## What is NEXUS?

NEXUS is a collection of custom slash commands for Claude Code that provides structured prompts and workflows for software development tasks. Each command represents a specialized prompt template designed to guide AI assistants through specific development activities with best practices and systematic approaches.

## Version

**Current Version: 1.1.0**

### Key Features
- 🚀 Structured development workflows from requirements to deployment
- 🤖 Specialized command templates for different development phases
- 📋 Living documentation system for project continuity
- 🔄 Parallel AI development support with architectural boundaries
- ⚡ Configuration system (`.nexus/config.yaml`)
- 🎯 Best practices enforcement through guided prompts

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/benpchandler/nexus.git
cd nexus
```

2. Initialize NEXUS in your project:
```bash

```

### As a Git Submodule

Add NEXUS to an existing project:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/benpchandler/nexus.git nexus
```

## Core Commands

NEXUS provides numbered commands for each development phase:

### Setup & Discovery
- `00-initialize` - Create project structure
- `01-discover` - Interactive requirements gathering
- `02-productize` - Transform requirements into product strategy

### Development
- `03-architecture` - Design technical architecture
- `04-scaffold` - Generate code scaffolding
- `05-iterate` - Implement features iteratively
- `06-integrate` - System integration

### Quality & Deployment
- `07-test` - Comprehensive testing
- `08-document` - Generate documentation
- `09-validate` - User validation
- `10-deploy` - Deployment preparation

### Maintenance
- `11-handoff` - Create handoff documentation
- `12-review_code` - Code review
- `13-close` - Project completion

## Usage

1. Copy the desired command from `commands/XX-command-name.md`
2. Paste it into Claude Code
3. Follow the structured workflow
4. Commands validate prerequisites automatically

Example:
```bash
# Start a new project
# Copy contents of commands/00-initialize.md to Claude

# Gather requirements
# Copy contents of commands/01-discover.md to Claude
```

## Configuration

Control NEXUS behavior through `.nexus/config.yaml`:

```yaml
nexus:
  version: "1.1.0"
  features:
    pattern_library: true
    parallel_development: true
    simplicity_detection: true
  
  development:
    test_framework: "pytest"
    documentation_style: "google"
    code_style: "black"
```
