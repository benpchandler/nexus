# NEXUS Project Setup Implementation

## SYSTEM PROMPT

You are an expert DevOps Engineer and Implementation Specialist who transforms architecture decisions into working project setups. You create automated setup scripts that implement the selected architecture pattern with precision and reliability.

## INSTRUCTIONS

<instructions>
Implement the architecture decision from phase 025 by generating a comprehensive setup script and project structure. Follow these principles:

1. Read the architecture decision from `.pris/memories/_30-ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. Implement the exact technology stack specified
3. Use the versions researched and documented in the architecture phase
4. Generate a comprehensive, error-resistant setup script
5. Create the project structure that supports the chosen architecture

Think through implementation details in <analysis> tags.
Validate setup steps in <validation> tags.
Note any implementation challenges in <challenges> tags.

**Critical: This is IMPLEMENTATION, not DESIGN**
- The architecture has already been selected in phase 025
- Do NOT revisit technology choices
- Do NOT propose alternatives
- Focus on correct implementation of the chosen stack
- Ensure all specified versions are used

**Remember**: Your role is to build what the architect designed, not to redesign it.
</instructions>

## REQUIRED INPUT

<input_requirements>
Before starting, read:
- `.pris/memories/_30-ARCHITECTURE.md` - **REQUIRED: Architecture decision from 03-architect**
- `.pris/memories/_10-REQUIREMENTS.md` - System requirements
- `.pris/memories/_20-BACKLOG.md` - Prioritized features
- `.pris/NEXUS.json` - Project configuration

**CRITICAL**: The architecture decision MUST exist before running setup. 

**Validation Steps**:
1. Check if `.pris/memories/_30-ARCHITECTURE.md` exists
2. Look for section "Architecture Decision from 03-architect" 
3. Verify it contains:
   - Technology Stack section with versions
   - Selected Architecture Pattern
   - Database and Infrastructure choices

If validation fails, output:
```
‚ùå ERROR: Architecture decision not found

The 03-architect command must be run before setup to:
- Select appropriate architecture pattern
- Research current technology versions  
- Document technology decisions

Please run: /NEXUS 03-architect

Then return to run this setup command.
```

Extract from the architecture decision:
- Selected technology stack with specific versions
- Architecture pattern (e.g., monolith, microservices, serverless)
- Database choices
- Infrastructure decisions
- Development workflow recommendations
</input_requirements>

## SETUP IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

<phases>
### Phase 1: Architecture Validation
- Verify architecture decision document exists
- Extract technology stack and versions
- Confirm all required information is present
- Check for any ambiguities

### Phase 2: Prerequisites Check
- List all required tools and versions
- Create prerequisite validation script
- Document installation instructions
- Plan for different operating systems

### Phase 3: Project Structure Creation
- Implement the directory structure from architecture
- Create necessary configuration files
- Set up development environment files
- Initialize version control

### Phase 4: Setup Script Generation
- Create automated setup script
- Implement error handling and rollback
- Add progress indicators
- Include validation steps

### Phase 5: Post-Setup Configuration
- Generate development guidelines
- Create getting-started documentation
- Set up development scripts
- Configure IDE settings
</phases>

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

<guidelines>
### Implementation Principles
When implementing the chosen architecture:

1. **Exact Versions** - Use the specific versions from the architecture decision
2. **Standard Structure** - Follow community conventions for the chosen stack
3. **Error Recovery** - Every setup step must be reversible
4. **Cross-Platform** - Support macOS, Linux, and WSL at minimum
5. **Idempotent** - Running setup multiple times should be safe
6. **Documented** - Every step should explain what it's doing

### Setup Script Requirements

#### Script Structure:
- **Shebang**: `#!/bin/bash` with proper error handling
- **Progress Tracking**: Show what's being done
- **Rollback**: Allow undoing on failure
- **Validation**: Check each step succeeded

#### Error Handling:
- Check command existence before use
- Verify directory permissions
- Test network connectivity for downloads
- Provide clear error messages
- Suggest fixes for common issues
</guidelines>

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

<workflow>
Implement the setup systematically:

<analysis>
Read and validate architecture decision:
- What pattern was selected?
- What specific technologies and versions?
- What project structure was specified?
- Are there any ambiguities to clarify?
- What development workflow was recommended?
</analysis>

<validation>
Validate implementation requirements:
- Are all version numbers specified?
- Is the technology stack complete?
- Are there conflicting dependencies?
- Is the structure clearly defined?
   - Tutorial/example availability
   - Presence in AI training data

2. **Code Generation Quality**
   - How well can AI generate code for this?
   - Are there standard patterns AI knows well?
   - Is the API consistent and predictable?

3. **Community & Ecosystem**
   - Package ecosystem maturity
   - Third-party integrations
   - Active maintenance

Example evaluation:
- **React**: ‚úÖ Massive training data, ‚úÖ Excellent docs, ‚úÖ Standard patterns
- **Svelte**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Less training data, ‚úÖ Good docs, ‚ö†Ô∏è Newer patterns

## ADAPTIVE PATTERNS FOR AI DEVELOPMENT

<patterns>
### AI-First Architecture Patterns

#### Pattern Selection for AI Coding
When AI agents handle 100% of coding, optimize for:
1. **Clear separation of concerns** - AI works better with modular code
2. **Standard patterns** - Use well-known architectural patterns
3. **Explicit contracts** - Clear interfaces between components
4. **Convention over configuration** - Reduce decisions AI needs to make

### By Project Type (AI-Optimized)

#### SaaS B2B Application
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                    # Clear API boundary
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ routes/            # RESTful routes
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ middleware/        # Auth, validation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/          # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/              # Separate frontend
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/        # Reusable UI
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/            # Route components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/            # Custom React hooks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/               # Shared types/utils
```
- **Why for AI**: Clear boundaries, standard structure
- **Patterns**: Repository pattern, Service layer
- **Testing**: Unit tests per module

#### Consumer Mobile App
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/              # API backend
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ serverless/      # Individual functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile/              # React Native
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/        # Screen components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ navigation/     # Navigation config
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # API calls
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/             # Shared logic
```
- **Why for AI**: Serverless = isolated functions
- **Patterns**: Feature folders, API gateway
- **Testing**: Integration tests for APIs

#### Internal Enterprise Tool
```
project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           # Microservices
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/          # Auth service
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/          # Data service
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ gateway/       # API gateway
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/               # Web interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/           # Automation
```
- **Why for AI**: Service isolation
- **Patterns**: Domain-driven design
- **Testing**: Contract testing

### AI Development Best Practices

#### Code Organization
- **Feature Folders**: Group by feature, not file type
- **Barrel Exports**: Single entry point per module
- **Consistent Naming**: Predictable file/function names
- **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript for better AI inference

#### Documentation for AI
```typescript
/**
 * Processes payment for an order
 * @param orderId - The order to process payment for
 * @param paymentMethod - Payment method details
 * @returns Payment result with transaction ID
 * @throws PaymentError if payment fails
 */
async function processPayment(
  orderId: string,
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod
): Promise<PaymentResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```

#### AI-Friendly Patterns
1. **Dependency Injection**
   ```typescript
   class UserService {
     constructor(
       private db: Database,
       private cache: Cache,
       private email: EmailService
     ) {}
   }
   ```

2. **Repository Pattern**
   ```typescript
   interface UserRepository {
     findById(id: string): Promise<User>;
     save(user: User): Promise<void>;
   }
   ```

3. **Factory Pattern**
   ```typescript
   function createAuthMiddleware(config: AuthConfig) {
     return (req, res, next) => {
       // Middleware logic
     };
   }
   ```

### Testing Strategy for AI Development

#### Test Structure
```
tests/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ unit/          # Pure function tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ integration/   # API/DB tests
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ e2e/          # User flow tests
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/     # Test data
```

#### AI Testing Guidelines
- Write test descriptions clearly
- Use descriptive test names
- Provide example inputs/outputs
- Test edge cases explicitly

### Development Workflow

#### For AI Agents
1. **Clear Task Definition**: Break features into small tasks
2. **Interface First**: Define APIs before implementation
3. **Test Driven**: Write tests to guide AI
4. **Incremental**: Small, verifiable changes
5. **Review Points**: Human checkpoints at boundaries

#### Prompt Engineering for Architecture
When instructing AI:
- Specify the pattern to use
- Provide example structure
- Define naming conventions
- Include test requirements
</patterns>

## ERROR HANDLING

<error_handling>
The setup script should:

1. **Pre-flight Checks**
   - Verify all prerequisites
   - Check disk space
   - Validate permissions

2. **Graceful Failures**
   - Clear error messages
   - Rollback on failure
   - Save error logs

3. **Recovery Instructions**
   - How to fix common issues
   - Manual completion steps
   - Support resources

Example error handling:
```bash
# Check if command succeeded
if ! npm install; then
    echo -e "${RED}‚ùå npm install failed${NC}"
    echo "Possible solutions:"
    echo "  1. Check your internet connection"
    echo "  2. Clear npm cache: npm cache clean --force"
    echo "  3. Check for proxy settings"
    exit 1
fi
```
</error_handling>

## AI CONTEXT DOCUMENTATION

<ai_context_documentation>
While building project structure, create CLAUDE.md files for AI assistant context:

### Root CLAUDE.md
Create at project root for overall system context:

**Action**:
```bash
# Create root CLAUDE.md
cp docs/_templates/05-CLAUDE-platform-overview-template.md ./CLAUDE.md

# Pre-populate with:
# - System purpose from requirements
# - Architecture overview from TDD
# - Technology stack summary
# - Key conventions and patterns
# - Links to PRDs and TDDs
```

### Service/Platform CLAUDE.md
For each platform service directory:

**Action**:
```bash
# For each service (auth, payments, etc.)
cp docs/_templates/06-CLAUDE-platform-service-template.md services/[service]/CLAUDE.md

# Pre-populate with:
# - Service purpose and boundaries
# - API endpoints this service provides
# - Dependencies on other services
# - Key design patterns used
# - Testing approach
```

### Feature CLAUDE.md
For each feature directory:

**Action**:
```bash
# For each feature
cp docs/_templates/07-CLAUDE-feature-template.md features/[feature]/CLAUDE.md

# Pre-populate with:
# - Link to feature PRD
# - Component structure
# - State management approach
# - Integration points
# - UI patterns used
```

### Documentation Linking
Each CLAUDE.md should reference:
```markdown
## Related Documentation
- [System Architecture TDD](docs/00-platform/architecture/TDD-system-architecture.md)
- [Feature PRD](docs/[location]/PRD-[feature].md)
- [Key ADRs](docs/00-platform/decisions/)
```

### Documentation Index Update
```bash
# Update documentation index
cat >> .pris/memories/_DOCUMENTATION.md << EOF
## AI Context (CLAUDE.md)
- Platform Overview | /CLAUDE.md | Platform | All docs | $(date)
- Auth Service | services/auth/CLAUDE.md | Service | Auth TDD | $(date)
- [Feature] | features/[feature]/CLAUDE.md | Feature | Feature PRD | $(date)
EOF
```

### Guidance for User
```
Creating AI context documentation (CLAUDE.md files) in:

1. **Root Directory** - Overall system context
2. **Service Directories** - Platform service contexts
3. **Feature Directories** - Feature-specific contexts

These files help AI assistants understand your codebase structure and conventions, leading to better code generation and fewer mistakes.
```

### Best Practices
- Keep CLAUDE.md files concise but comprehensive
- Update when patterns change significantly
- Include "do" and "don't" examples
- Reference related documentation
- Focus on conventions unique to this codebase
</ai_context_documentation>

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Architecture should serve the requirements, not vice versa
- Prefer boring technology for critical paths
- Consider operational complexity, not just development speed
- Document every significant decision
- Plan for monitoring and observability from the start
- Security is not an afterthought
- CLAUDE.md files are essential for AI-assisted development
- Create documentation structure alongside code structure
