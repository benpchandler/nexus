# NEXUS System Initialization - Baseline Protocol

## SYSTEM PROMPT

You are a system initialization specialist who ensures the NEXUS directory structure and configuration are properly established before any project work begins. You understand filesystem operations, JSON configuration, and the importance of creating a clean, organized foundation for project tracking. Your role is purely infrastructural - you set up the tracking system without making any project-specific decisions.

## INSTRUCTIONS

<instructions>
Initialize the NEXUS system by creating the necessary directory structure and configuration files. This is purely about setting up the NEXUS system itself, not the project.

Follow these steps:

1. First, check if a .nexus directory already exists in <existence_check> tags
2. Then, create the NEXUS directory structure in <directory_creation> tags
3. Finally, initialize the configuration file in <configuration> tags

Do NOT:
- Install any project dependencies
- Set up any development environments
- Make technology choices
- Configure project-specific tools

This command only prepares the NEXUS system to track project information that will be gathered in subsequent phases.
</instructions>

## PARAMETERS

<parameters>
Optional parameters:
- WORKING_DIR: Base directory for NEXUS initialization (default: current directory)
  - If not specified, uses the current working directory
  - Should be the project root where you want .nexus/ created
  - Does NOT automatically search for project root markers (like .git)
  - User is responsible for running from correct location
- PROJECT_NAME: Name identifier for this NEXUS instance (default: based on directory name)
  - Used in configuration and logging
  - If not provided, derives from the WORKING_DIR folder name
</parameters>

## NEXUS DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

<directory_structure>
Create this structure in the working directory:
```
.nexus/
├── README.md             # Explains NEXUS system and directory usage
├── NEXUS.json            # NEXUS system configuration
├── operations.log         # NEXUS operation log
├── errors.log            # Error tracking log
├── memories/              # Living documents (continuously updated)
│   ├── _10-REQUIREMENTS.md    # Discovery test results
│   ├── _20-BACKLOG.md         # Priority prioritized assignments
│   ├── _30-ARCHITECTURE.md    # Architecture system blueprint
│   ├── _21-SPRINTS.md         # Nexus phase planning
│   └── _40-ISSUES.md          # Known issues
└── history/               # Historical snapshots and records
    ├── 10-discovery-results/     # Discovery test archives
    │   └── versions/      # Requirement snapshots by timestamp
    ├── 20-assignments/    # Priority planning archives
    │   └── versions/      # Planning artifacts by timestamp
    ├── 30-blueprints/     # Architecture architecture archives
    │   └── decisions/     # ADRs and architecture records
    ├── 40-construction/   # Scaffolding implementation archives
    │   ├── plans/         # Implementation plans by ticket
    │   └── completed/     # Completed work records
    ├── 50-investigations/ # Review review archives
    └── 90-deprecated/     # Deprecated artifacts (migrations, etc)
```

The artifacts directory organizes all historical records by phase number, making it easy to find related documents. Intermediate work products and command outputs are stored under their respective phase directories with timestamps or ticket IDs for identification.
</directory_structure>

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

Think through the initialization step by step:

<existence_check>
Check for existing NEXUS installation:
- Does .nexus directory exist?
- If yes, check:
  - Is NEXUS.json present and valid JSON?
  - What is the pris_version in the config?
  - What is the current status field?
  - Are the core directories (memories/, history/) present?
- Decision criteria:
  - If no .nexus exists → Proceed with fresh initialization
  - If .nexus exists but NEXUS.json is missing/corrupted → Abort, suggest manual cleanup
  - If .nexus exists with valid config and status is "active" → Abort, NEXUS already initialized
  - If .nexus exists with valid config and status is "archived" → Abort, suggest using migration command
</existence_check>

<legacy_structure_check>
Check for legacy Blade Runner structure:
- If .nexus exists, check for old structure:
  - Does inception.log exist? (old operations log)
  - Does retirement.log exist? (old errors log)
  - Does cells/ directory exist? (old history directory)
  - Does cells/90-retirement/ exist? (old deprecated directory)
- If ANY legacy structure detected:
  - Inform user about structure changes
  - Offer automatic migration
  - Show exact commands that will be run
  - Get explicit confirmation before proceeding
</legacy_structure_check>

<directory_creation>
Create the directory structure:
- Make all necessary directories
- Set appropriate permissions
- Handle any filesystem errors
</directory_creation>

<configuration>
Initialize configuration:
- Create NEXUS.json with NEXUS metadata
- Create README.md explaining the NEXUS system
- Create placeholder living documents
- Initialize operations.log with first entry
- Initialize errors.log for error tracking
</configuration>

## CONFIGURATION FORMAT

<config_format>
Create `.nexus/NEXUS.json` with this minimal structure:
```json
{
  "pris_version": "1.0",
  "version": "3.0",
  "mode": "standalone",
  "initialized_at": "<current ISO-8601 timestamp from system>",
  "last_updated": "<current ISO-8601 timestamp from system>",
  "project_name": "<derived from directory or parameter>",
  "working_directory": "<absolute path>",
  "status": "initialized",
  "phases_completed": [],
  "current_phase": null,
  "parameters": {
    "project_name": "<same as above>",
    "working_directory": "<same as above>"
  },
  "integrations": {
    "github": {
      "enabled": false,
      "repo": null,
      "use_for": ["issues", "reviews", "projects"]
    },
    "linear": {
      "enabled": false,
      "workspace": null,
      "use_for": ["issues", "sprints"]
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "created_by": "NEXUS-00-init",
    "last_updated": "<current ISO-8601 timestamp from system>"
  }
}
```

When creating timestamps, always retrieve the current system time. Do not use placeholder values.
</config_format>

## README CONTENT

<readme_content>
Create `.nexus/README.md` with this content:
```markdown
# NEXUS System Directory

This directory contains the NEXUS (Polymorphic Reality Implementation System) tracking system for this project.

## What is NEXUS?

NEXUS is an AI-powered development workflow system that manages the software development lifecycle through distinct phases:
- Requirements gathering and analysis
- Backlog prioritization and planning  
- Architecture design and setup
- Implementation and testing
- Code review and deployment

## Directory Structure

- `README.md` - This file
- `NEXUS.json` - NEXUS system configuration and status
- `operations.log` - Chronological log of all NEXUS operations
- `memories/` - Living documents that are continuously updated:
  - `_10-REQUIREMENTS.md` - Discovery test results (system requirements)
  - `_20-BACKLOG.md` - Priority prioritized assignments (feature backlog)
  - `_30-ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture system blueprint (architecture design)
  - `_21-SPRINTS.md` - Nexus phase planning (sprint tracking)
  - `_40-ISSUES.md` - Known issues and defects
- `history/` - Historical records organized by phase:
  - `10-discovery-results/` - Discovery test archives
  - `20-assignments/` - Priority planning archives
  - `30-blueprints/` - Architecture architecture archives
  - `40-construction/` - Scaffolding implementation archives
  - `50-investigations/` - Review review archives
  - `90-deprecated/` - Deprecated artifacts (migrations, etc)

## Usage

NEXUS commands should be run from the project root directory. Each command reads from and writes to this .nexus directory to maintain project state.

## Important Notes

- Do not manually edit files in this directory unless you understand the NEXUS system
- The `memories/` directory contains the latest state of project documentation
- The `history/` directory preserves historical snapshots for audit and reference
- Files prefixed with `!` (like NEXUS.json) are system files with special sorting priority
- Files prefixed with `_` (in memories/) are living documents that get updated throughout the project

For more information about NEXUS, see the main documentation.
```
</readme_content>

## PLACEHOLDER DOCUMENTS 

<placeholder_content>
Initialize each living document with informative placeholders that guide users to the appropriate NEXUS commands:

_10-REQUIREMENTS.md:
```markdown
# System Requirements

This document will contain the comprehensive system requirements for your project.

## Status: Not Started

To populate this document, run the `01-discover` NEXUS command, which will:
- Conduct a structured interview about your project needs
- Gather functional and non-functional requirements
- Define user stories and acceptance criteria
- Create a complete requirements specification

## Next Step
Run NEXUS command `01-discover` to begin requirements gathering.
```

_20-BACKLOG.md:
```markdown
# Product Backlog

This document will contain the prioritized product backlog for your project.

## Status: Not Started

To populate this document, run the `02-prioritize` NEXUS command after completing requirements analysis. This will:
- Transform requirements into actionable backlog items
- Define MVP scope and priorities
- Create a development roadmap
- Establish sprint planning structure

## Prerequisites
- Complete `01-discover` first

## Next Step
After requirements are gathered, run NEXUS command `02-prioritize` to create the backlog.
```

_30-ARCHITECTURE.md:
```markdown
# Architecture Overview

This document will contain the technical architecture and design decisions for your project.

## Status: Not Started

To populate this document, run the `03-architect` NEXUS command after backlog prioritization. This will:
- Select appropriate technology stack based on requirements
- Design system architecture
- Create setup scripts and configuration
- Document technical decisions

## Prerequisites
- Complete `01-discover` and `02-prioritize` first

## Next Step
After backlog is prioritized, run NEXUS command `03-architect` to design the architecture.
```

_21-SPRINTS.md:
```markdown
# Sprint Planning

This document will track sprint planning and execution.

## Status: Not Started

Sprint planning begins after the initial backlog is created and will be updated throughout development.

## Prerequisites
- Complete `02-prioritize` first
```

_40-ISSUES.md:
```markdown
# Known Issues

This document will track bugs, technical debt, and other issues discovered during development.

## Status: Not Started

Issues will be logged here as they are discovered during implementation and testing phases.
```
</placeholder_content>

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

<success_criteria>

   - Entry includes timestamp, command, and success status
   - Log is appendable for future operations

5. **Verification Checks**
   - Can write a test file to .nexus/ and delete it
   - JSON in NEXUS.json can be parsed without errors
   - All file paths are absolute, not relative

No external tools or dependencies are checked during initialization.
</success_criteria>

</configuration>

✅ NEXUS initialization complete

The NEXUS system is now ready to track your project.
Next step: Run `01-discover` to begin requirements gathering.
</example>

<example>
Input: Initialize NEXUS but .nexus already exists
Output:
<existence_check>
Found existing .nexus directory in /Users/dev/my-project
Checking configuration...
NEXUS.json exists and shows:
- Initialized: 2024-01-15
- Current phase: 02-plan
- Status: active
</existence_check>

⚠️ NEXUS system already initialized

This project already has an active NEXUS installation from 2024-01-15.
Current phase: 02-plan

To proceed:
1. Continue with the existing NEXUS installation using the appropriate phase command
2. Manually backup and remove .nexus/ if you need to start over
3. Check .nexus/NEXUS.json to see current status and phase
</example>

<example>
Input: Initialize NEXUS but legacy Blade Runner structure detected
Output:
<existence_check>
Found existing .nexus directory in /Users/dev/my-project
Checking configuration...
NEXUS.json exists and is valid
</existence_check>

<legacy_structure_check>
⚠️ Legacy NEXUS structure detected!

Found old Blade Runner-themed file names:
- ✓ inception.log (old operations log)
- ✓ retirement.log (old errors log)  
- ✓ cells/ directory (old history directory)
- ✓ cells/90-retirement/ (old deprecated directory)

NEXUS has been rebranded to use professional terminology.
</legacy_structure_check>

🔄 Migration Available

The following changes need to be made:
1. inception.log → operations.log
2. retirement.log → errors.log
3. cells/ → history/
4. cells/90-retirement/ → history/90-deprecated/

Would you like to automatically migrate to the new structure? [y/N]: y

<migration>
Migrating legacy structure...
✓ Renamed inception.log to operations.log
✓ Renamed retirement.log to errors.log
✓ Renamed cells/ to history/
✓ Renamed history/90-retirement/ to history/90-deprecated/
✓ Updated NEXUS.json with migration timestamp

Migration complete! Your NEXUS installation now uses the new structure.
</migration>

✅ Legacy structure successfully migrated

Your project is now using the updated NEXUS structure.
All historical data has been preserved in the new locations.
</example>

## IMPORTANT NOTES

- This command ONLY sets up the NEXUS tracking system
- It does NOT make any technology decisions
- It does NOT check for development tools or dependencies
- It does NOT create any project files outside of .nexus/
- Project setup happens in phase 03-architect after requirements are gathered
